## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project!
In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images and to put your model into an app.
Given an image, your app will predict the most likely locations where the image was taken.

By completing this lab, you demonstrate your understanding of the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. 

Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.


## Project Instructions

### Getting started

Execute the following steps:

>**Note:** Complete the following notebooks in order, do not move to the next step if you didn't complete the previous one.

1. Open the `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions there
2. Open `transfer_learning.ipynb` and follow the instructions
3. Open `app.ipynb` and follow the instructions there

## Evaluation

Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the CNN project rubric.  Review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission.  All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.


## Dataset Info

The landmark images are a subset of the Google Landmarks Dataset v2.
